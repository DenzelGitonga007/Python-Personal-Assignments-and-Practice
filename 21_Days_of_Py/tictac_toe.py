#TIC TAC TOE GAME
## PART ONE -- Draw the tic tac toe board
# - Create a 3x3 board (like in tic tac toe). Obviously, they come in many other sizes 
# (8x8 for chess, 19x19 for Go, and many more).
# - Ask the user what size game board they want to draw, 
# and draw it for them to the screen using Python’s print statement.
