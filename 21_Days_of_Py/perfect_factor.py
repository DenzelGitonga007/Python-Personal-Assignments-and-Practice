# #Python coding challenge **12
# # A "Perfect Number" is a number in which the sum of its factors (excluding itself) are equal to itself.
# Write a function that can verify if the given integer n is a perfect number, 
# and return True if it is, or return False if not.
# Example
# n = 28 has the following factors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14
# 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28 therefore n = 28 is a perfect number, so you should return True.
# n = 25 has the following factors: 1, 5, 25
# 1 + 5 = 6 therefore n = 25 is not a perfect number, so you should return False.

print("...Finding a perfect number...")
